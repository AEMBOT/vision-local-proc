# vision-local-proc
This is designed to run on any co-processor properly configured with OpenCV and Python.
The co-processor must also have a configured usb camera.
To run this code, you must do 

$ python runner.py

in the terminal.
This will run the grip-generated code and show some videos.
## Goals and Purpose
This repo will eventually be suitable to run at competitions
once this system is better known. It will include network table 
functionality.  Please follow all of 6443's conventions.
